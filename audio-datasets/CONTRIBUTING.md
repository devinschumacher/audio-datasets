## How to contribute? 
- Claim the dataset you wish to contribute from the [list](https://github.com/jim-schwoebel/voice_datasets/blob/master/README.md) (KUDOS to 
[jim-schwoebel](https://github.com/jim-schwoebel)) by opening a new issue on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/DAGsHub/audio-datasets) and name it after the dataset. Please make sure that the dataset wasn't claimed. 
- Open a new DagsHub repository and upload the data to its DVC storage (e.g., [dataset repository](https://dagshub.com/DagsHub/Librispeech-ASR-corpus)).
- Write information about the dataset in the README file (e.g., [Librispeech ASR corpus README](https://dagshub.com/DagsHub/Librispeech-ASR-corpus/src/master/README.md)). 
- Add relevant tags to the repository and files.
- Add the following labels to the repository:
  - `dataset` 
  - `audio`
  - `hacktoberfest`
- In the GitHub [audio-datasets](https://github.com/DAGsHub/audio-datasets) project:
  - Open a new branch named after the dataset.
  - Add a directory named after the dataset with the README file.
  - Commit and push the changes to GitHub.
  - Create a pull request on GitHub.
- Optional: Share the project in the `#hacktoberfest` channel on the [DagsHub Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/9gU36Y6).
